 * The Bomber algo does not like 3 or more consecutive characters in a given string to be same
 * For example: If the given string is "adbcccbbd" the bomber algo will first bomb "ccc" and then "bbb", so the final output string will become
 * "add". The bomber algo will destroy the characters only if there are 3 or more coninuous occurence of same characters in string.
 * Write a code of the bomber algo. The method takes a string as an input and returns bombed string as an output
 * Input aaabcccdee
 * Output bdee
 * Input abcdeeeeddcbfgf
 * Output abccbfgf
